1. Project Overview
Cryptic Quest is an interactive mystery investigation game where the player steps into the role of a detective solving crime cases. Each case contains clues, suspects, evidence, and multiple paths the player can take. As the investigation progresses, new information appears and the case file evolves.
The game focuses on exploration, deduction, and piecing together events from clues found across different modules.
